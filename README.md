# ðŸŒ¾ Rainfall vs. Crop Yield Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model using linear regression from scratch to predict crop yield based on rainfall.

## ðŸš€ Highlights
- Feature scaling
- Custom cost function and gradient descent
- Predictions for new rainfall values
- Performance evaluation using MSE and RÂ²
