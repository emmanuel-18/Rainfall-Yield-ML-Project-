# 🌧️ Rainfall vs Crop Yield: Linear Regression from Scratch

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the relationship between rainfall and crop yield using a linear regression model implemented from scratch.

## 📊 Dataset
- Synthetic or sourced data with features like:
  - Rainfall (mm)
  - Temperature
  - Crop Type
  - Yield (tons per hectare)
- Data is preprocessed to focus on rainfall vs. yield.

## ⚙️ Methods
- Normalization
- Gradient descent implementation
- Loss function: MSE
- Evaluation metrics: MSE, R²

## 📈 Results
- Show convergence graph
- R²: (insert value here)
- Scatter plot with regression line

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open [this notebook in Google Colab](link)
2. Run cells sequentially

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Python fundamentals
- Numpy, Matplotlib
- Understanding gradient descent
- Model evaluation

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Use sklearn for comparison
- Extend to multivariate regression
- Real-world dataset
